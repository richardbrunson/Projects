# Projects
These files are some samples of my work.
I have also worked on several more sites and applications but can't share those because they are owned by others (even though I did the development).

You can also see some of my website work at the URLs below.
The files listed above (if you are at https://github.com/richardbrunson/Projects) are further samples of my work in other languages.

If you view the source code of each project, you can see how my JavaScript coding has evolved over the years.
The oldest project is the JavaScript Superset which I wrote in 2009.
If you view the source code for that project, you will see a very old style of JavaScript.
But the great thing about JavaScript is that it all still works!
I try to stay current and use the latest JavaScript practices. 

Enjoy! :)

### http://iq01.com

This is my personal website that I use both for business and personal projects.
At the bottom of the page, you can select from over 30 color themes which are "remembered" after leaving the page (assuming you have cookies enabled).
I have attached some of the scripts in this Projects directory.

### https://iq01.com/x/mock/bull.php

This is a bullion tracker I wrote to track investments.
(All of the data on this page -- except the actual gold and silver prices -- is mock data, used only for illustration purposes of the functionality.)
This tracker displays the current market gold and silver prices, along with various investments and their current values.

### http://iq01.com/x/chakra

This is a favorite project of mine.
It randomly draws spinning Chakras and is a good meditation aid.
I developed every aspect of this project, including the user interface and scripts.
Note: hitting the question mark key toggles the help panel.
Enjoy!

(Note: for best results, Chakra should be run on a machine with hardware graphics acceleration.
Otherwise it can run pretty slowly.
Even with hardware acceleration it can still run slowly depending on the complexity of the chakra.)

### https://iq01.com/x/mapper.php

This is a random map generator written entirely in JavaScript.
It uses a "random walk" algorithm to generate maps for role-playing games.
The "Random Seed" field allows you to repeat a map if desired.
Use an empty field to generate a random map, or use a specific string or numeric value to repeat a map.
Using the same value will always redraw a map so you can "save" any desired map!

### https://iq01.com/x/cre.php

Cre is a roleplaying game quest generator.
It was written entirely in TypeScript and generates random quests, along with random item and character names.
(See the above links for the actual TypeScript version if interested.)
Suggestions for improvement are welcome and I will do my best to incorporate them if I think they are worthwile.
(Cre is a work-in-progress and I will provide updates as I go.)

### http://iq01.com/javascript_superset.html

I developed the JavaScript Superset several years ago to extend JavaScript's functionality.
Fortunately, ES6 has many of these features now included.
I haven't edited the Superset in years and don't plan to -- it is just a showcase of my work.

# Helper Mini-Apps

### http://iq01.com/helpers/digital-sum.html

This mini-app computes the "digital sum" of any numeric string.

### http://iq01.com/helpers/text-formatter.html

This mini-app formats text based on user settings.
If there are any additional [requested features](mailto:helper-request@iq01.com), email me and I will consider adding them!

### http://iq01.com/x/timer.html

A simple timer I wrote for counting down the seconds before my shift ends at a boring job.
Nothing fancy, just something to watch that's a little more interesting than watching the grass grow! :)
