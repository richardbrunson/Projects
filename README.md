# Projects
These files are some samples of my work.
I have also worked on several more sites and applications but can't share those because they are owned by others (even though I did the development).

You can also see some of my website work at these URLs...


http://myhipcondition.com

This is a Tragically Hip fan-site.
Originally, all of the pages were hard-coded and was a maintenance nightmare.
I converted all the pages into React-based pages pulling in all assets from a database.
Now every time they want to make a change, they only have to update the database and everything is automatic.
I also added an extensive search engine.
And I also designed the site and color scheme!


http://iq01.com

This is my personal website that I use both for business and personal projects.
At the bottom of the page, you can select from over 30 color themes which are "remembered" after leaving the page (assuming you have cookies enabled).
I have attached some of the scripts in this Projects directory.


http://iq01.com/x/chakra

This is a favorite project of mine.
It randomly draws spinning Chakras and is a good meditation aid.
I developed every aspect of this project, including the user interface and scripts.
Note: hitting the question mark key toggles the help panel.
Enjoy!

I developed the JavaScript Superset several years ago to extend JavaScript's functionality.
Fortunately, ES6 has many of these features now included.
I haven't edited the Superset in years and don't plan to -- it is just a showcase of my work.


And here are a couple more samples...
